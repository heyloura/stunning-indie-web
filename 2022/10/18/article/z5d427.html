                  "Wow, did the week fly by. That was probably helped along by the fact that I had a 48-hour migraine which left Wednesday and Thursday in a blur.<h3>House</h3>Monday was a holiday that I had off of work. That let me get to some long overdue painting that is needed in sun room since we redid the windows. I sanded, used wood filler, and applied a layer of stain blocking to the wood. Hopefully that will stop any pine knots from bleeding through. Lastly a layer of white primer went up. It'll still take us weeks to get everything finished. My tentative goal is before Thanksgiving. I continued painting in the sunroom on Sunday and have the first coat of off-white on the walls!<h3>Homeschooling</h3>My record journal is looking fantastic this year. I try to fill it in weekly with pictures and a record of what we've done. This year I bought stickers and an instant printer to make the pages more colorful and lively. <h3>Work</h3>One thing about having a migraine on a work day, is that my mind is in no position to do coding. I've tried it and it just doesn't work out. What I can do however, is plan. So I cleaned out project management system, re-organized tasks, made some documentation and got together a better plan for the next few weeks. Bonus points, it made me excited to get back to coding at the end of the week.<h3>Life & Exercise</h3>I did get to dance classes on Wednesday evening despite the migraine. Tap dancing was... interesting ðŸ˜†. Tai Chi was a no-go for me on Thursday so I forced myself to go on Saturday. We did some Old Yang, Short Yang Sword, and as always 108 Long Yang. When I taught on Sunday I reviewed the first part of Short Yang Sword, followed by 18 Movement Fan, and then challenged myself to do 108 in 18 minutes. We crushed it and did it in 20 minutes! It's inspired me to document some of these forms on my weblog."
